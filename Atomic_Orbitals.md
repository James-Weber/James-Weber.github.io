## 1. Shells, Sub-shells & Quantum Numbers

Chemical reactivity, the formation and destruction of chemical bonds, is determined to a large extent by the energy of valence electrons - the highest energy electrons found in an atom - since these are the electrons almost invariably involved in bonding. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of elements, we need to understand their electronic structure.
When looking at how electrons are arranged in atoms, in high school you will first encountered the concept of shells. Using this methodology the electron configuration of, for example, chlorine would given as 2, 8, 7 where 2, 8 and 7 refer to the number of electrons in the shells.
This basic description can be improved by splitting each shell into one or more sub shells. These sub shells are termed s, p, d and so on. These letters refer to the atomic orbitals which makes up each sub shell. Depending on the syllabus covered in high school, you may have covered atomic orbitals but as some curricula do not, this is where this course will start. 
Atomic orbitals form the simplest units of electron arrangement in an atom - each atomic orbital can hold up to 2 electrons although we often need to consider atomic orbitals which hold one or no electrons for bonding purposes. Within an atom, each atomic orbital is unique (has a unique set of three quantum numbers - see below) but can be categorised as a particular type of orbital (s, p, d etc). 
Each type of atomic has a characteristic shape and, depending on the syllabus, you may have discussed how the overlapping of orbitals leads to bond formation. We will explore the idea of atomic orbitals further in this course and formalise your understanding. 

### Quantum Numbers 
Every electron in an atom has a unique set of 4 quantum numbers - 3 of these describe the atomic orbital the electron resides in and the 4th4th refers specifically to the electron. 
The 4 quantum numbers are:
1. Principal quantum number, nn
2. Angular momentum quantum number, ll
3. Magnetic quantum number, mlml
4. Intrinsic angular momentum quantum number (spin), msms
 

### Principal Quantum Number, n
The values of nn corresponds to the shell containing the electron. The valence electrons in the 1st1st period (H, He) are in the n=1n=1 shell, those in the 2nd2nd period (Li…Ne) are in the n=2n=2 shell and so on. Matters are complicated by the introduction of d orbitals later on but this is beyond the scope of the course. 
Returning to the example of chlorine's electron configuration of 2, 8, 7; the "2" electrons are found the n=1n=1 shell, the "8" electrons in the n=2n=2 shell and "7" electrons in the n=3n=3 shell.
nn takes integer values starting at 1 ⟹ n=1, 2, 3, 4….
