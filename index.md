### Research
I am a third year PhD student working with Dr Alex Archibald in the Centre for Atmospheric Science, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge. My research focuses on computational modelling of the Earth's atmosphere in the context of past, present and future climates.   

I am interested in interactions between the biosphere and climate, mediated via the chemical oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compouds (BVOCs). BVOCs affect the atmosphere's oxidising capacity and thus methane lifetime and ozone (with consequences for the Earth's radiative budget) and contribute to aerosol formation and growth. Aerosols scatter radiation and aid cloud formation thus cooling the atmosphere. These interactions have the potential to cause feedback loops which could oppose or exacerbate climate change. Focusing on the interactions of peroxy radicals from various BVOCS, and incorporating this into the global climate models UKCA and UKESM. 

I have been involved in the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) looking at biogeochemcial feedbacks which will contribute to the evidence base used by the IPCC.

### Teaching
I have taughted undergraduate and graduate chemistry courses included first year General Chemistry, third year Atmospheric Chemistry and fourth year Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Change. I have also demonstrated in the first year laboratory classes.

I have 1000 hours experience in A Level, IB and GCSE Maths, Physics and Chemistry and university level Chemistry, including working with charities The Access Project and Generating Genius.
